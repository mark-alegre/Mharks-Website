                    - ‚úÖ The footage of hostages, many of them teenagers and younger, being seized and driven away crying and pleading with their captors, was as harrowing as the sight of the corpses Hamas left behind.

                    - ‚úÖ The slaughter of Israeli civilians on 7 October was intended to strike terror into the Israeli psyche and inflict a lasting wound. The hostage-taking was done for other reasons: as a brake on Israeli retaliation and to trade for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Seven weeks later, it has clearly worked better as a bargaining chip than as a deterrent.

                    - ‚úÖ The estimated 240 hostages in Gaza did not stop the intense, relentless bombing of Gaza or the ground offensive on 27 October. Only now, almost a month on, has a four-day lull been agreed, arguably when it suits the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). If Saturday‚Äôs crisis, which halted the second round of releases, can be overcome, the ceasefire could be expanded by a few days perhaps, but Israel has left little doubt the war will go on.

                    - ‚úÖ The planned release of as many as 150 Palestinians, on the other hand, is an important gain for the mastermind of the 7 October attack, Yahya Sinwar, who spent more than 23 years in an Israeli prison. It is where he became fluent in Hebrew and acquired an in-depth grasp of Israeli politics and society. It is also where he developed a determination to liberate the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
